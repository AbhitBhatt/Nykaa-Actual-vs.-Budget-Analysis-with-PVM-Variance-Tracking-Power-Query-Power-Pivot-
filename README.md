# Nykaa Business Performance Dashboard  

This project is a comprehensive Excel-based advanced analytical 10 page **Reports+Dashboard** built on Nykaa‚Äôs sales and financial data.  
Original Raw dataset provide 2 tables i.e ActualSales (>470k rows and 30 Columns) and Budget/Target_Sales (>50k rows and 30 Columns).
Power Query is used to normalize, clean, transform the data and converting the data into **2 Fact** & **5 Dimensions** Tables i.e Actual_Sales, Budget/Target_Sales, Dim_Sku, Dim_Date, Dim_Location, Dim_Cluster & Dim_Channel and these data later on added to Power Pivot Data Model Data Modelling where I created relationship between the tables forming the **Galaxy Schema** (as there are 2 Fact Table) and also created multiple Medium to Advanced level **DAX** for achieving desired result for the report.
It uses **Pivot Tables, Charts, and Variance Analysis**  to provide deep insights into Net Revenue (NR), Gross Profit (GP), budget comparisons, performance across multiple business dimensions and how much they perform to meet the requirement of Targeted/Budget benchmark by Cluster, Locations, Channels, etc.

## 1. Pareto & SKU Level Turnover  
- **Objective**: Identify high-performing products and understand their contribution to overall revenue and 2 charts on Products and Categories to find Sku level Turnover. 
- **Features**:  
  - Pareto chart highlighting the **80/20 rule** (20% products contributing to ~80% revenue).
  - Obervation: Out of 4205 Products 140 are the ones that contribute 80% of PAT.  
  - SKU-level turnover pivot for granular product performance tracking.
  - 2 **Pivot Tables and 2 chart** on top of that to see what Products and categories are contributing revenue in % of total Revenue and by how much of their Units in % is contributing by how much of total units.
  - Example from the image like **HairCare** category contributes total of staggering **13.7%** of Total NR eventhough in terms of Total Units sold it is just **2.7%** which showcase even with less units sold this product still generates a higher value of Revenue.
- **Visuals**: Bar/line charts.

## 3. Time Series  
- **Objective**: Track performance over time to identify seasonal or monthly trends across NetRevenue, COGS(Cost of Goods & Servie), Gross Profit & PAT(Profut After Tax).  
- **Features**:

## 4. Marketing & Efficiency  
- **Objective**: Evaluate marketing investments and efficiency in driving sales.  
- **Features**:  
  - **1st Pivot table and Line Chart** on top of that pivot showcase **Yearly** and monthly NR generated and Money spend on marketing (in % value of NR).
  - **2nd pivot Table and Line chart** on top of that showcase Yearly and Monthly **Volume(MT)** sold and sum of Money spend on marketing.
  - **3rd Pivot Table** showcase Location and Year wise efficiency of marketing means for every **‚Çπ1** of marketing how much revenue we generated.
  - KPIs: ROI%, efficiency ratios, and channel-wise marketing effectiveness.  
- **Visuals**: Line  charts showing correlation between spend and nr/volume.

## 5. Expenditure  
- **Objective**: Break down and analyze expenditures across categories.  
- **Features**:  
  - **1st Pivot table & Waterfall Chart** on expenditure on 6 fields i.e. RawMaterial, Trade&Disc, VariableCost, S&D_cost (sales & department), G&A cost and Marketing Cost. 
  - **2nd Pivot Table and Column&Line Chart** on Net Revenue and expenditure on Raw Material(in % value of NR) over years (as we see from the first/earlier chart that we spend most on **Raw Material** around 50% of total NR).
  - and finally **6 pivot Tables** on Year, Location, ClusterHead, Channels, Products and Categories on capturing  NR,Ebidta,	Ebidta%	of NR, COGS,	COGS% of NR, Tax,Tax% of NR, Trade&Disc,	T&D% of NR.

## 8. Variance Analysis  
- **What is Variance Analysis?**
- **Answer** - Variance Analysis:Variance analysis on Gross Profit (GP) and Net Revenue (NR) is done to evaluate how product categories perform by comparing Actuals against Budget/Targeted,helping to identify revenue shortfalls, cost impacts, and areas of outperformance.
- **Formula DAX:**
- **GP_Variance% (Gross Profit Variance %)**: *([Actual_GrossProfit] - [Budget_GrossProfit]) / [Budget_GrossProfit] * 100*
- **NR_Variance% (Net_Revenue Variance %)**: **([Actual_Net_Revenue] - [Budget_Net_Revenue]) / [Budget_Net_Revenue] * 100*
- 
- **Objective**: Deep dive into performance gaps.
- 
- **Features**:  
  - **1st Pivot Table and Scatter Chart** or *variance Analysis on Categories* for GP_Variance% and NR_Variance% to showcase how much and by what % they are able to achieve or miss the Budget/Target mark.
  - **2nd Pivot Table and Scatter Chart** or *variance Analysis on Products* for GP_Variance% and NR_Variance% to showcase how much and by what % they are able to achieve or miss the Budget/Target mark.
  - **4 Pivot Tables** on Variance Analysis on Year, Location, ClusterHead and Channels to observe their performace across Quarters or Years.
  - 
- **Visuals**:  
 - Scatterplot
